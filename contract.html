the Covenants herein, as well as for any other damages caused by Executive to
the Company.&#160; The Company and Executive
also acknowledge that the harm that would result from a violation of the

of monetary damages in compensation thus may not be an adequate remedy.&#160; Therefore, the Company and the Executive
agree, in consideration of the compensation and other terms and conditions of
this Agreement, that either the Company or the Executive shall be entitled to
obtain equitable remedies to enforce these obligations, including an order by
any competent court or arbitrator to enjoin and restrain the unauthorized
disclosure or continued possession, custody or control of Proprietary Information,
and/or to enjoin and restrain the other actions identified herein in respect of
such covenants.&#160; If the Company or the
Executive seeks such equitable relief, then that party shall be entitled to recover

avoid litigation and its attendant costs, delays and risks, the parties agree
that all disputes concerning this Agreement, or any matter related thereto, or
arising out of or related in any manner to the employment relationship
described herein, shall be decided by binding arbitration, in accordance with
the terms of this Agreement, pursuant to the Federal Arbitration Act (&#147;FAA&#148;).&#160; The parties acknowledge that they have been
specifically informed of their right to counsel with attorneys of their own
choosing and that in signing this Agreement, they are irrevocably waiving their
rights to a trial before a judicial tribunal or trial by jury in any court,
except as is necessary to enforce this Agreement, preserve the status quo, or
confirm or enforce any award resulting from arbitration under this Agreement;
and that the entire controversy between them is being submitted to arbitration;
and that they are waiving the right to assert a claim of fraudulent inducement
to arbitrate, or reliance on faulty advice of counsel.</font></p>

<p style="margin:0pt 0pt 12.0pt;text-indent:36.0pt;"><font size="2" style="font-size:10.0pt;">The parties agree to submit this controversy to binding arbitration
before a single neutral arbitrator selected by the parties through the auspices
of the American Arbitration Association (&#147;AAA&#148;) from the panel of arbitrators
of the AAA located in Los Angeles, <a href="/contracts/tagged/california" id="california">California</a>, who shall be experienced in
matters regarding the subject matter of this Agreement.&#160; The AAA&#146;s Employment Arbitration Rules then
in effect shall apply, and the arbitration proceeding shall be conducted at the
offices of the AAA in Los Angeles, <a href="/contracts/tagged/california" id="california">California</a>, or at such other location as
shall be mutually agreed by the parties. <a href="/contracts/tagged/texas" id="texas">Texas</a> law shall govern this

the state district court of Harris or Nueces Counties, <a href="/contracts/tagged/texas" id="texas">Texas</a>, or Los Angeles,

party from requesting from such court to enter any injunctive relief which is
otherwise appropriate under applicable law for the limited purpose of maintaining
the status quo of the parties pending arbitration, or as part of any final
award of arbitration or in aid of arbitration.</font></p>

<p style="margin:0pt 0pt 12.0pt;text-indent:36.0pt;"><font size="2" style="font-size:10.0pt;">The provisions of other sections of this Agreement concerning attorney&#146;s
fees, such as for pursuing injunctive relief, are independent of this
Paragraph.&#160; Subject to that exception,
the parties agree that the initial costs of arbitration, including the deposit
and any fees charged by the AAA, shall be paid equally by the Executive and the
Company, and that a failure by either party to pay such costs timely shall
constitute a default of this Agreement.&#160;
An award of arbitration costs shall be governed by the provisions
below.&#160; The parties agree that the
prevailing party shall be entitled to recover all arbitration costs and reasonable
attorney&#146;s fees.&#160; If the Executive shall
prosecute any federal or state statutory claim for discrimination which imposes
a different standard for recovery of attorney&#146;s fees or costs, then as to that
claim alone the Arbitrator shall be authorized to award reasonable attorney&#146;s
fees or costs to the prevailing party in accordance with applicable law.</font></p>

<p style="margin:0pt 0pt 12.0pt;text-indent:36.0pt;"><font size="2" style="font-size:10.0pt;">The Arbitrator shall render a reasoned award within
thirty (30) days after the close of the hearing.&#160; The parties agree to abide by and perform any
award rendered by the Arbitrator.&#160; A
judgment of a court having jurisdiction may be entered upon the award, which
shall then be enforceable as would any other judgment enacted under applicable
law.</font></p>
